introduction :>
this is the introduction of how and what i will do in this code so, i am making a chatbot by using tkinter
and pyttsx3 in python which means that this chatbot will have its own gui 

lets start:>

1/import pyttsx3
2/import tkinter as tk
3/from tkinter import *
4/import webbrowser

5/ to use pyttsx3:>

important things are :>

to use this we need to use this code 

engine = pyttsx3.init()

now in this code engine is the variable in which the pyttsx3 will be used 

6/ to set voice type 

a/voice set up
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)

here getProperty means that this function will get that property like if we want voice then it will get
voice function and setProperty means that this function will set that property as their final property
and 0 means that it will have male voice and 1 means it will have female voice and .id means that it will
that this is the id verification

7/volume set up 

engine.setProperty('rate', 150) 
engine.setProperty('volume', 1.0)

rate means the speed of the voice assistant and volume means the volume only 

8/setting it up to say something
engine.say("the thing which you want it to say)
engine.runandwait()

engine.say will make it say what you want it to say and engine.runandwait will run the programme

9/ now using tkinter 

10/ setting up the base of the gui

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("friday")

here root is the variable in which the tkinter is comprised which means if we want to use tkinter anywhere
we can simply access it by using root function and root.title will set up the title of the function

11/setting up the geometry and colour

root.geometry("500x700")
root.config(bg = "light blue")

the root.geometry will set the height and width of the gui and root.config will set the colour

12/setting up the header

label1 = tk.Label(root,text = "friday",height = 2,width=10,font=50,bg="white",fg="black")
label1.pack(pady=20)

in this the label1 is the variable in which all these functions comprise in this the tk.Label is the 
configeration code in which all the details are there like height, width, font, background, fg
label1.pack function will run this code and pady means the y-axis

13/setting up the entry

entry1 = tk.Entry(root, width=50)
entry1.pack(pady=10)

entry1 is the variable in which all the functions comprise and tk.entry is the function in which we will set
up its width usually entry function is used to take the userinput meaning that the entry function will 
allow the function to take the userinput and proceed and entry.pack will run the function

14/setting up the button 

button1 = tk.Button(root,text = "to youtube",command = speak_text,height = 5, width = 10)
button1.pack(pady=60,side=tk.LEFT, padx=10)

this function will set the button which will run the button in this text will be name of this button and
command will be the function according to which the programme mill work

15/setting up the functions which will run these programmes

def speak_text():
    text = entry1.get()
    if text:
        engine.say(text)
        engine.runAndWait()

    else:
        engine.say("please enter some text")
        engine.runAndWait()

in this function the text variable will get the entry1's input and proceed 

16/root.mainloot

this function will run the whole function controlled by tkinter

17/ 
import pyttsx3
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import *
import webbrowser
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)
engine.runAndWait()

def speak_text():
    text = entry1.get()
    if text:
        engine.say(text)
        engine.runAndWait()

    else:
        engine.say("please enter some text")
        engine.runAndWait()

def star_func():
    info = entry2.get()
    if info == "open youtube":
        webbrowser.open("https://www.youtube.com")
    else:
        engine.say("sorry but i cannot proceed")

def go_func():
    infor = entry2.get()
    if infor == "open prime":
        webbrowser.open("https://www.primevideo.com/")
    else:
        engine.say ("sorry but i cannot proceed")
        
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("friday")

root.geometry("2000x800")

root.config(bg="light blue")

label1 = tk.Label(root,text = "friday",height = 2,width=10,font=50,bg="white",fg="black")
label1.pack(pady=20)

entry1 = tk.Entry(root, width=50)
entry1.pack(pady=10)

entry2 = tk.Entry(root, width=50)
entry2.pack(pady=110)

button= tk.Button(root,text="start function",command=speak_text,height=5,width=10)
button.pack(pady=40)

button2 = tk.Button(root,text = "to youtube",command = star_func,height = 5, width = 10)
button2.pack(pady=60,side=tk.LEFT, padx=10)

button3 = tk.Button(root, text = "to prime",command = go_func,height= 5,width = 10)
button3.pack(pady = 60,side = tk.RIGHT,padx= 10)
root.mainloop()

here the webbrowser is the module which will run open the web apps according to the command given

this is how this whole code works
